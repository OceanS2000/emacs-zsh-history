This is a tiny tool to encode/decode Z-shell history file.

In zsh history file, some functional bytes are escaped with meta
character. As of it, non-ascii texts in history file are sometimes
undecipherable.

According to `init.c' of zsh, followings are meta characters.

- 0x00, 0x83(Meta), 0x84(Pound)-0x9d(Nularg), 0xa0(Marker)

For these bytes, 0x83(Meta) is preceded and target byte is `xor'ed
with 0x20.

This file provides encoder and decoder for these bytes, so that
UTF-8 string in history file can be handled in Emacs.
